# Bondi - Bootstrap Practice Project

## üìÑ About the Project

This is a simple training project created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5.  
The layout is based on a free PSD template called "Bondi", which I used to practice converting designs into responsive websites.

I also added some improvements and design tweaks to make the layout look cleaner and more visually appealing.

You can view a live demo by opening the main HTML file.
